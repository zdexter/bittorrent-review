reactor.py
  :80 - does [:] do anything to an array?

  I like that you create a poll() method and are explicitly calling it in a loop.
  Perhaps loop() should be implicit in the reactor? It seems good to encapsulate this
  behavior in the reactor class. Then it'd be easier to keep things clean by starting 
  the reactor in one place regardless of whether you're seeding or leeching.
  Also, this would presumably make it easier/possible to leech and seed from the same client.

network.py
  die() nicely encapsulates end-of-connection behavior. Super clean way of doing it.

torrentstrategy.py
  connect_and_ask_n_peers() needs a docstring. What are you asking them - whether they'll
   handshake? Which pieces they have?

torrent.py
  Nice work keeping __init__() clean by moving initialization from torrent files into its
   own function.
  :50 - I couldn't seem to change the representation of an array in the repl by
   using the * operator. What does this line do - destructuring?
